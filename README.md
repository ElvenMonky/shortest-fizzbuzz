# shortest-fizzbuzz
#### Contains shortest solutions to fizzbuzz in various programming languages

** **

## Rules:
"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

## Common Lisp:
Common Lisp is a general-purpose programming language and thus has a large language standard including many built-in data types, functions, macros and other language elements, and an object system (Common Lisp Object System).Typing discipline: Dynamic, strong. Filename extensions: lisp,.lsp,.l,.cl,.fasl. Scope: Lexical, optionally dynamic.

## Contributing:
1. Alphabetically add your addition here to [README.md](README.md) in the format `[<language name>](<file-name>), <number-of-bytes> bytes`. GitHub tells you the number of **bytes** for any file. 
2. Add a file to the root of the repo in the form of: `<language-name>.<file-extension>` that satisfies the rules above. 

## Notes:
Try to write a detailed commit message.

If possible make sure you end your file with a newline at the end and are using LF as opposed to CRLF Line sequences.

Feel free to improve on existing solutions if you can do better :)
